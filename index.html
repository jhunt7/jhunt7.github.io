        I am a second year graduate student in the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/mathstat/index.html">school of mathematical and statistical sciences</a> at Clemson University. My research interests include number theory, L-functions, modular forms, partitions, and combinatorics. My advisor is TBA
    </p>
    <p>
      In Spring 2023, I graduated from Vanderbilt University with a BA in Mathematics with honors and a minor in computer science. I was advised by Larry Rolen and awarded highest honors on the successful defense of my senior thesis. From 2017-2019, I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). While attending NCSSM, I particpated in multiple sessions of their research in mathematics (RMath) program.

    <p>
      When not doing math, I enjoy singing and acting, as well as hiking and camping.

    <p> Rolen's
      Beginning in Fall 2018, I am a tenure-track assistant professor at Vanderbilt University.
      During the 2017-2018 year, I was at Georgia Tech as a Visiting Assistant Professor.
      Previously, I was a tenure-track assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, and I was a Research Associate at The Pennsylvania State University, working with George Andrews.
      From 2013 to 2015, I was a postdoc at Universität zu Köln, Germany working with Kathrin Bringmann.
      I completed my BA in Mathematics with Honors in 2023 at Vanderbilt University, wo and my Ph.D. at Emory University in 2013 with Ken Ono.
      My research interests lie in number theory and more specifically modular forms, harmonic Maass forms, partitions, and L-functions.
      You can find my CV here.

    <p> Asimina's
      My name is Asimina and I am a fifth year mathematics PhD student at the University of Connecticut. I am supported by the Graduate Fellowship for STEM Diversity (GFSD). My interests are in number theory and algebra, specifically, arithmetic geometry and algebraic number theory. My advisor is Álvaro Lozano-Robledo.
      I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market!
      In Spring 2020, I graduated from Macaulay Honors at Baruch College (CUNY) with a BA in Mathematics and minors in Philosophy and Interdisciplinary studies of New York. In Fall 2017, I placed second at the Traders@MIT competition (the largest intercollegiate algorithmic trading competition in the country). In Spring 2018, I worked in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with Group One Trading as a Trade Analyst Intern. In the summer of 2018, I participated in the NSF funded number theory REU at Oregon State University and was advised by Holly Swisher. In Spring 2019, I studied abroad in Budapest Semesters in Mathematics (BSM). In the summer of 2019, I participated in the NSF funded number theory REU at Texas A&M University and was advised by Riad Masri. My senior year, I was the first student at Baruch to write an honors thesis in math, and was advised by Andrew Obus.
      I have a 4.5 year old female German Shepherd named Athena. Her instagram is @athenahamakiotes. In my free time, I like to do Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I also enjoy swimming, going on walks/hikes, and listening to music.
